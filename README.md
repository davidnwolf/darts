Not many people are thinking about the mathematical implications of darts while playing, but that's all I can think about. Triple twenty has the highest point total, but it's such a small area. On the other hand, 19 and 17 are so close together, so should I aim for the middle and hope I miss by a little bit? This program draws a dartboard and uses a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the optimal aiming spot on the dartboard for someone based on skill level. While I wish I could aim for and hit triple twenty everytime, the numbers tell everyone but the pros to aim for bullseye.
